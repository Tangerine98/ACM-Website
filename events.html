             <p>ACM student chapter, FISAT organized the hour of code this year on December 1st, Saturday at Sacred Heart Public School, Mookannoor for class VIII students. The program commenced at 10.15 am in the computer lab soon after the school assembly and the formal meeting was inaugurated by the principal of SH School, George Joseph sir and was presided by the administrator of SH School, Rev.Fr.Varghese Manjely, Dr.Prasad J C, HOD of CS Dept, FISAT, Ms.Sruthy Suresh, staff co-ordinator of ACM student chapter ,FISAT and Lakshmi A S, chairperson of ACM student chapter ,FISAT. The welcome speech was delivered by Merlin Mariam Moncy, second year CS student, FISAT. </p>

             <p>The session began with an introduction to Scratch, a visual programming language and the one hour class was handled by Visrutha Arundhathi R & Maria Sajan, second year CS students , FISAT. About 10 ACM volunteers co-ordinated the whole session .The students were given the opportunity to workout the whole new things taught in their systems and they were given goodies & stickers for motivation. The section came to an end by 11.30 am .Staff co-ordinator ,Ms.Sruthy Suresh concluded the session after the distribution of certificates to the students who attended the session. The whole event was a grand success and the very motive of the event, the hour of code, to spread knowledge in Computer Science ,was clearly met by this event , on behalf of ACM.</p>

             <p>Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and
              statistical models that computer systems use to progressively improve
              their performance on a specific task. Machine learning algorithms
              build a mathematical model of sample data, known as &quot;training data&quot;,
              in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly
              programmed to perform the task.To update the young minds with new
              technologies, the ACM FISAT hosted a tech talk by Dr Shihabudheen K.V
              who is working as an Assistant professor, Department of Electrical
              &amp;Electronics, TKM College of Engineering, Kollam. The talk was held on
              September 11, 2018 at the conference hall from 10 am to 12.00 pm. The
              tech talk was inaugurated by the Computer Science and Engineering HOD.
              The class dealt with introduction to machine learning, its
              applications and various algorithms. Indeed it was a worth session for
              all.</p>

             <p>The Google's applied CS with android workshop  was conducted on date by Mr.Vishak Ajith. The workshop's aim was to create a understanding about android development and provide a hands on experience for the students. There were 24 of students all from CSE dept, FISAT. The class were divided into two sessions. 10-12:30 and 1-4:15 . The first session dealt with the basic theories about data  structures and features of android studio. In the  second session the students were made to make a android application by referring with the course material provided by google. The session ended by 4:10 and the vote of thanks was done by yedhin kizhakkethara  in the presence of our HOD Dr.J.C.Prasad and ACM fisat student chapter staff in charge Mrs.Sruthy. A Momento was presented to Mr.Vishak as a token of our appreciation.</p>

              <p>ACM, the world&#39;s largest educational and scientific computing society, delivers resources that
                advance computing as a science and a profession. ACM’s Professional and Student chapters
                worldwide serve as hubs of activity for ACM members and the computing community at large.
                They provide seminars, lectures, learning forums and networking opportunities with peers and
                experts across the computing spectrum.
                An ACM Student chapter was started by Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering, at
                FISAT and was inaugurated by Dr. G Santhosh Kumar, Associate Professor, CUSAT on 22nd June
                2016. It aims to serve as a gateway to forums, panel discussions, and symposia that further aids
                student&#39;s professional development.</p>
